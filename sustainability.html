            <li><strong>Packaging:</strong> We use recyclable and compostable materials in all of our packaging to minimize our carbon footprint.</li>

        <h3>Our Environmental Impact</h3>
        <p>Every item you purchase from Kandy's ThriftStore helps reduce the environmental footprint of the fashion industry. Thrift shopping diverts clothing from landfills, reduces the need for new manufacturing, and lowers overall pollution.</p>
        <p>Here’s the impact you make with every purchase:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reduced Textile Waste:</strong> By buying second-hand, you contribute to less textile waste being sent to landfills.</li>
            <li><strong>Lower Carbon Footprint:</strong> Upcycled clothing requires less energy and resources to produce than new clothing, reducing your carbon footprint.</li>
            <li><strong>Water Conservation:</strong> The fashion industry is one of the largest water consumers. By choosing thrift, you help conserve water by avoiding the production of new garments.</li>
        </ul>
